- **statusquo** : Scale of support for the status-quo.
- **vote** : a factor with levels: `A` will abstain `N` will vote no (against Pinochet) `U` undecided `Y` will vote yes (for Pinochet).

## Prediction Model

- App is built using Shiny server and deployed on Shiny apps.
- `ui.R` and `server.R` code is stored on github repository.
- This presentation is build using R Slidify option. code is stored in github Repository.
- `server.R` contains 2 functions:

  1. `chile_predict` function : This function runs the randomforest classification after data cleansing and predicts what action voter will take.
  2. `chile_plot` function : This function plots existing pattern of Chile voter and then using classification current voter prediction is displayed.
